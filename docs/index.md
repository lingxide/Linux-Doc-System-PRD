# Welcome to IAM-LC Public Knowledge Base System

## What would you find in this KBS

Mostly you will find Linux-related article in this KBS.

As a unix admin I faced lots of tricky issues in my daily work, thanks to whom I listed in credit, most of them get resolved properly. In return I decided to sort it out and publish them into this KBS.

I have initiated a topic - **How To's**, to explain some workaround with specific issues. Another topic called **Baseline** is in my backlog.

The article you see is selected and converted from my private KBS system, making sure a clear and short explaination of some tricky issues.

It would be my pleasure if you found something helps.

## Why am I building this KBS

As less and less update from my blog, due to terribly editor of WordPress, I moved most of creatives to my private KBS.

Some article of my private KBS may contains sensetive data, including project information and business secret hence a desensitization process is made to valuable articles, and being reformatting, I will public them there.
